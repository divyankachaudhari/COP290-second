# Maze Wars
We were prompted to make a pacman like game with our modifications. So, this is maze wars - a multiplayer maze game. There's a new maze generated everytime from DFS. Built in C++ using sockets and SDL library. 

## Instructions
- Fork repository
- ```cd Subtask-1```
- ```make```
- ```./game``` to start the game
